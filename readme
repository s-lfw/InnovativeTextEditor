Usage of the application:
    <without arguments> - basic task. Reads data in specified format from System.in and
        prints results to System.out. With 'test.in' on Intel Core i5 @3550 works about 1.5 secs
    -server <path_to_dictionary_file> <port> - additional task, server side. Starts the server
        with dictionary from file on specified port
    -client <host> <port> - additional task, client side. Connects to the server by host and port.
        Works as same as in basic task: reads data in specified format (without dictionary data)
        from System.in and prints result to System.out. Unlike the basic task, access to dictionary
        performed over network
